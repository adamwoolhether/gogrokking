# gogrokking

Implementing algorithms from Grokking Algorithms into go. In-book examples are given in Python.

The books repo has algos for many different languages.
This is just a collection of my own implementations and notes as I go through the book. 

I'm keeping the implementations close to the original for now.
Planning on revising many into using structs and methods and write tests in the future to compare the performance results.
